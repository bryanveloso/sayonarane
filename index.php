		<h2>new layout!!! *dances*</h2>
		<h5>[monday, 03.08.08 <b>@</b> 04:11 am]</h5>
		<p>z0mg it's a new layout!! after 2 years of having the same layout, i finally got the inspiration to change it. i've been hating the old one for a while now, but i couldn't come up with an idea for a new one and the prospect of fixing up my previously horrendous coding seemed too daunting to attempt.</p>
		
		<p>but it's up! after two days (and again lots of help from <a href="http://bryanveloso.com/" target="_new">bryan &hearts;</a>), it's almost completely done (i only have a few more pages to update). i wouldn't say this is one of my best designs (it's kind of weak, actually), but it's definitely one of my favorites because of <b>ALL THE KONKON GOODNESS</b>. if anyone's been wondering who the girl appearing all over the header is, it is <a href="http://wiki.theppn.org/Konno_Asami" target="_new">Konno Asami</a> (nicknamed KonKon or Kon-chan) of <b>Hello! Project</b>. she is the cutest girls in the WORLD and never ceases to make me happy when i'm surrounded by her photos. thus, this layout = happiness!</p>
			
		<p>the images in the polaroids rotate, so feel free to refresh again and again to enjoy version 2 of SAYONARA,NE: <b>KONchan  ☆ paraDISE</b> (and yes, i'll be adding more KonKon images because there is no such thing as too much KonKon).</p>
		
		<p>and now, with out further ado...*refreshes*</p>
		<h2>fixed IE bugs!</h2>
		<h5>[monday, 10.09.06 <b>@</b> 11:08 pm]</h5>
		<p>so i <i>finally</i> decided to fix ugliness internet explorer created whenever viewing this website. that mostly consisted of three things - aligning the sidebar properly, changing widths so tables would no longer be broken, and making it so that the pretty border/padding around my images was visible (click on any card page to see what i mean). ^^
		<p>the only thing i can't fix is the little lotus images on the sidebar. they're PNG files, and for those of you who don't know, GIF's aren't the only file types that allowe transparency. PNG files do very nice transparency, and can even do things like opacity changes (if you wanted to do like a drop shadow, for example). the only problem? IE. IE doesn't read PNG transparency, so it's showing this ugly background color behind the lotus images that's not supposed to be there. :/ but at least the layout isn't broken anymore, so i'll have to live with it.</p>
		<p>IE users, i hope you're happy. i fixed things so that you don't have to stare at ugliness whenever you see this page. however, i still think you should get <a href="http://mozilla.com">firefox</a>. c'mon, it's free!</p>
		<h2>small updates</h2>
		<h5>[friday, 09.15.06 <b>@</b> 08:13 pm]</h5>
		<p>the form is working, but i's not pretty. sorry! i'm new to forms, so i don't know how to work them. ^^; for now i'm just happy that i <i>get</i> them...the rest will come later. also, i know things look awful in internet explorer, and i <i>do</i> plan to fix it, eventually, just because i can't stand knowing that to some people it's all broken. it's functional, though, so i recommend you get <a href="http://mozilla.com">firefox</a> to see it the proper way. everyone knows IE sucks now anyway. xD</p>
		<p>i don't like the word "home" for this page, but i don't like "main" or "updates" either. i need a niftier name. the root domain is reserved for my future (maybe?) blog, but http://sayonarane.net/home/ is just...not pretty. i thought of "ne," but http://sayonarane.net/ne/ just seems confusing.</p>
		<p>in other news, i've been busy playing <b>ragnarok online</b> at this new server, which i co-own, <a href="http://nyxsis-ro.com/">nyxsis</a>. go check it out (especially if you're a <i>hello! project</i> fan, because we've started <a href="http://hellogirls.selenitia.net/">a guild</a> for us ragnarok/h!p fans ;D)!! we have an event for our 100th account opened coming up soon! ^^ um...i'm mostly just writing stuff cuz i didn't want to ignore the updates. so i'm done now.</p>
		<h2>about tcg's</h2>
		<h5>[friday, 09.01.06 <b>@</b> 07:04 pm]</h5>
		<p>i've mostly created this website out of need. need for something useless. they're called trading card games ... <i>online</i> trading card games. i used to just host them on my livejournal community, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/jenvie/profile/">jenvie</a>, but lj has been giving me error messages telling me that my posts are too long. so i'm moving everything here. xD yes, it's sad that that was my motivation behind this...sue me.</p>
		<h2>welcome!</h2>
		<h5>[friday, 09.01.06 <b>@</b> 06:50 pm]</h5>
		<p>i have created this website! and um...i'm sort of not liking it already. it's my own fault for trying to save myself work. i'm not unhappy with it enough to change it, though. xD i wanted to keep it simple (for my own sanity), and i've always loved the image i used in the header, which features the characters <b>oosaki nana</b> and <b>komatsu nana</b> (aka "hachi") from the insanely awesome manga series, <i>NANA</i>.</p>
		
		<p>many thanks goes do my wonderful fiancé, <a href="http://avalonstar.com/">bryan</a>, for helping me with the coding when i felt lost (pretty much most of the time). keep in mind that i haven't made a real website in years. ^^;</p>
