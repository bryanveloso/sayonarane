			<h1>About</h1>
		  <p>Here you will find information about TCG's in general as well as about Heart Station specifically and how it works.</p>
			
			<h3>About Trading Card Games</h3>
			<p>A TCG is an online <b>Trading Card Game</b>. Online TCG's are all about collecting cards (or small graphics in the shape of cards). Cards are divided into decks, and your objective is to collect the decks that you like!</p>
			
			<p>When you collect all cards in a deck, you are considered a <i>master</i> of that deck and you receive rewards for completing it! TCG's also have <i>levels</i>, which are based on the number of cards you have. When you reach a certain number of cards, you can level up and receive rewards for that, too! For more information about earning cards, Find the appropriate section below. ^^</p>
			
			<h3>About Heart Station</h3>
			<p><b>Heart Station</b> is J-Music (Japanese Music) TCG. It was named after Utada Hikaru's song and album that go by the same title. I chose it because "station" can be interpreted as a radio station. You might notice I use this idea as a theme in the forums and games! ^^</p>
			
			<p>Heart Station will cover all genres of music, but there are a few things this TCG will <u>not</u> cover. They are:</p>
			
			<p>- Hello! Project (TCG options: <a href="http://genki.musume.ca/">Genki Beam!</a>, <a href="http://verybeauty.clavis-sama.com/">Very Beauty</a>)<br>
			- Johnny's Entertainment (TCG options: <a href="http://je-and-u.clavis-sama.com/">JE-and-U</a>, <a href="http://verybeauty.clavis-sama.com/">Very Beauty</a>, <a href="http://countdown.love-jam.net/">Countdown</a>)<br>
			- visual kei artists (TCG options: <a href="http://telegraphboys.freehyperspace5.com/">Telegraph Boys</a>)<br>
			- Kpop, Cpop, any non-Jpop (TCG options: <a href="http://endless.kakusei.org/index.php">Endless Moment</a>)<br>
			<strike>- Kpop/Jpop crossover artists that other TCG's specialize in (TCG options: <a href="http://www.heartchu.com/">Heartchu</a>)<br>
			<i>(currently: TVXQ/DBSK/DBSG/Tohoshinki, Bi/Rain, Shinhwa, SS501)</i></strike></p>
			
			<p>This is an effort to cut down was an already <b>immense</b> subject. Some of these categories are popular and I understand that it may upset you, but please don't ask me to include them or give me a list of reasons why I should. I made sure that all of these categories are ones that are already being specialized in on other TCG's, and are the most likely to spawn new TCG's if others close down.</p>
			
			<h3>Types of Cards</h3>
			<p>Heart Station will focus on PV decks, but that doesn't mean that other types of deck will be neglected! Artist and puzzle decks are also featured promenently, and let's not forget about the occasional special deck. &hearts; Here are some example cards..</p>
				
			<p><b>Artist cards:</b><br>

			<p><b>PV cards:</b><br>
			<img src="/random/jpop_sample01.gif"> <img src="/random/jpop_sample02.gif"> <img src="/random/jpop_sample03.gif"></p>
			
			<p><b>Puzzle cards:</b> (okay, so it's deck, no a card.. ^^; i'll get it cut up soon!)<br>
			<img src="/random/jpop_puzzle01.jpg"></p>
			
			<p>Artist, PV and Puzzle cards are worth 1, while special cards will be worth 2.</p>
			
			<h3>Levels</h3>
			<p>Levels in this TCG are based on your card worth/value. You can keep track of your level with this chart:</p>
			
			<center><p><table style="width: 445px;">
			<tr><td class="tablekey1"><center>Level</center></td><td class="tablekey2"># of cards</td><td class="tablekey1"><center>Level</center></td><td class="tablekey2"># of cards</td></tr>

			</table></p></center>
			
			<p>** While Heart Station is the last level, HS offers extra rewards and a custom achievement badge for every 1,000 cards earned after Heart Station. The custom level badge will feature an image of the member's choosing, and they also get to choose a name based on any artist's song name (for example, a member can choose "Valenti Station" based on BoA's song) for their milestone.</p>
