			<h1>Donate</h1>
		  <p>You can donate any of the following to help us out (and get rewards in return!):<br>
			- PV decks<br>
			- level badges<br>
			- link buttons</p>
			
			<p>Look for the appropriate section below to find out more information about each!</p>
			
			<h3>PV Decks</h3>
			<p>Before you start, check the <a href="claims.php">list of claims</a> to make sure the PV you want to donate isn't claimed.</p>
			
			<p><b>How it works:</b><br>
			- you must claim a PV (<a href="http://sayonarane.net/station/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=3">here</a>) before donating it<br>
			- you have 1 week to send in your donation, after which time someone else may take your claim<br>
			- you can claim up to 5 PV's at a time<br>
			- maximum of 3 PV's per artist</p>
			
			<p>New release PV's will always have a 1 week limit, but after this TCG has 50 PV decks the time limit will be extended to 2 weeks.</p>
			
			<p><b>Quality and limits:</b><br>
			- PV's must be DVD rip or good TV rip quality (none of those blurry, tiny, old mpg videos, plz)<br>
			- do not use PV's where the water marks (TV station logos, etc) are too prominent<br>
			- images must cropped down to the video or window size (i don't want your desktop in the picture xD)<br>
			- images must be JPG, PNG or BMP only, and no smaller than 500px in width<br>
			- send a <i>MAXIMUM</i> of 40 screen caps, and a <i>MINIMUM</i> of 30!<br>
			- include a lot of variety! &hearts; decks look boring if there's too many similar pictures</p>

			<p><b>PV Staff:</b><br>
			PV Staff are members that screen cap PV's as their job in this TCG, which is EXTREMELY important! Because their help is so appreciated, I offer the following perks:</p>
			
			<p>- they get first choice on claiming PV's (if a new PV comes out and 3 people try claiming it at once, priority goes to PV Staff)<br>
			- they will be assigned PV's to screen cap sometimes, but they get to choose <b>10 artists</b> that their assignments will consist of. that means they don't have to screen cap random artists that they don't know anything about!<br>
			- they may claim up to 3 PV's at a time <i>per artist</i> that they chose. that means at any given point they may have up to 30 PV's claimed!<br>
			- they get to take an extra choice card from each deck they donate<br>
			- there is only a 1 week limit on new releases. on everything else they have a 2 months to donate!<br>
			- they, of course, get a generous amount of staff pay per deck donated :3 (<b>NOTE:</b> this begins after 50 decks are made)</p>
			
			<p>current PV Staff: iceymoon, Rina, Katoshi. <b>want to be on the PV Staff?</b> contact iceymoon!</p>
			
			<h3>Level Badges</h3>
			<p>When making level badges, please keep the following in mind:</p>
			
			<p>- JPG, PNG or GIF only.<br>
			- dimensions are up to you, but keep it no larger than 400px in width or 300px in height.<br>
			- images must be J-Music related and feature accepted artists (see <a href="about.php">about</a> for what is not accepted).<br>
			- must say the level name somewhere on the badge (see <a href"about.php">about</a> for a list of level names).</p>
			
			<p><b>Naming Format:</b><br>
			Please name your badges in the following format:<br>
			» <i>YOURNAME#_LEVELNAME.png/jpg/gif</i><br>
			example: iceymoon2_simple.png</p>
			
			<p>If you have donated a badge set before, please include the number of the set you're donating after your name (in the example i put "2" after my name, which would make it my second set of badges). For the level name, please exclude the word "station" (since the word appears in all levels).</p>
			
			<p><b>Rewards &amp; Limits</b><br>
			- donators will receive vouchers for rewards when the TCG is open for pre-join (temporary).<br>
			- you may donate a maximum of 2 sets per month (they must be complete sets).</p>
